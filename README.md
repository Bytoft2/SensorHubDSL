# SensorHubDSL
This project was an assignment in the "Model-driven Software Development Project" course on the Masters in SoftwareEngineering at SDU spring 2021.

The DSL aims to ease the process of setting up IoT systems in the Fog and Edge layer of the IoT environment. In IoT there are multiple ways of doing communication and a ton of sensors to make use of. Finding out what libraries you need, setting up and reading data from sensors, sending data, and storing and visualizing the data can be somewhat tedious and repetitive tasks. The goal of this project is therefore to make a DSL where you can specify which devices and sensors you are using, and baseline code for logging, sending, storing and visualizing data will be generated.
